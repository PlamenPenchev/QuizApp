# QuizApp
My Third Project for the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics from Udacity. 
It is a Java Quiz app with three activities. The first one is the Main menu where the user can start the quiz or quit the app. 
The second one is holding the questions, there is a toggle button which activates hints for RadioButton 
questions - if the user marks the wrong answer while the toggle is active a toast will display he's wrong. 
When finishing with the quiz and the submit button is tapped the user is navigated to the third activity 
which also takes data values from the quiz activity. One holding an array with information regarding 
each false answer and one holding the score. A toast is activated when the activity launches. 
The user has an option to display the score via button which will also provide an individual information 
regarding each wrong answered question.
